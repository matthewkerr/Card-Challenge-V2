Concentration Card Game - A part of the interview process with Circadence

An example of this code working can be found here :

WARNING :: Circadence has access to this code if you copy mine,  and cheat, they will know.

Game Description
When the user clicks the ‘New Game’ button, shuffle the deck of cards, then layout the cards, face down, in 4-rows with 13 cards in each row.
The user clicks on two cards. As the user clicks on a card, the card is flipped over so users can see the # and suit of the card.
If the numbers on the two cards selected by the user are the same, then those two cards are removed from the board. If the numbers on the cards do not match, then the cards are flipped back over and remain on the board.
The game ends when the user has matched all cards.

API used is http://deckofcardsapi.com/ for shuffling the deck and selecting cards when laying them out on the board.
